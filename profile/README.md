<h1>DictationDaddy</h1>
</div>

## A more accurate dictation tool compared to Google, Siri, Otter, Windows and Mac's built-in dictation tool. It transcribes with higher accuracy and do modifications on text with voice.

Existing dictation tools are not very accurate. They also suck at making changes via voice. For example, if I have to delete the sentence, I just cannot say "delete the sentence." If I have to change the name, I just cannot say "change the name to Daniel." I would have to manually go and change it. Similarly, if I have to convert a paragraph into a list, I cannot do that with the current dictation tools.

But with Dictation Daddy. I can say commands like 
- **Make it a list:** Converts text into a list format.
- **Reword it:** Modifies the wording of a sentence or phrase.
- **Add a heart emoji:** ‚ù§Ô∏è
- **Remove the first line:** Deletes the initial line of the text.
- **It's Nat N-A-T:** correct spelling of "Nat."
- **Add my Calendly link:** Inserts my Calendly URL here.


A lot of time when we are texting to somebody, replying on Gmail, linkedin, Slack, there is a lot of information that we need to pick up from here and there like calendly link, attachments. 
There is a lot of formatting that we need to do, making sure paragraphs are created, bullet points, grammar checks. There are a lot of self contemplation like does this line look correct or not, should I make it more formal or informal?

With DictationDaddy, I want to eliminate all of the unnecessary steps required to put the message across to others. Things like "attach my resume," "attach my last PDF," "schedule a meeting with Daniel" all this should be achieved by Voice.
If everything goes correct, this can potentially replace keyboards and personal assistants for a lot of users and will become a single interface through which they will check their email, calendar, or interact with other people and tools on internet.
